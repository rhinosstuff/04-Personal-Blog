## Description
This is a summary of what I did for the week 4 challenge. I was given no starter code and was required to build everything from scratch. There was very specific requirments on this project. Including a DOM file structure. The only freedom was in the CSS styling and layout. 

### Main Criteria

Form Landing Page: 

    Requires 3 input fields, (User Name, Blog Title, Blog Content). 

    Alerts displayed if any input field is left empty. 

    On submit user input is stored in local storage and blog page is opened.
       

Blog Page:

    Dynamically displays user input from localStorage.

    Creates HTML elements to house, Blog Title, Blog Content, User Name

    Has a back button to go back to Form Landing Page.

    Has a link to My Portfolio 


    Both Pages: have a button to toggle between 'light' and 'dark' mode.
